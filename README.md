# MoodSync: Music Recommendations Based on Your Daily Mood

This full-stack project connects user moods to music recommendations. Users log their daily mood, and the app generates personalized music playlists or song recommendations based on their emotions.

# Tech Stack
  - SQLite for local database storage.
  - React for the frontend.
  - Node.js/Express for the backend.
  - Leverages the Spotify API for rel time song suggestion.


# Unique Features
  - Mood Logging: Users select their mood (happy, sad, excited, calm, etc.) using emoji-based buttons.
  - Music Recommendations: Based on the mood, a playlist is generated with Spotify API integration.
  - Mood History: Visualizes mood trends over time using a colorful chart.
  - Random "Feel Better" Button: Users get a random uplifting quote or track when they feel down.
  - Gamified Streaks: Rewards users for consistently logging their moods daily.

# Run in your local system 
  - Navigate to the frontend folder and do `npm install`.
  - Navigate to the backend folder and do `npm install`.
  - Set the `.env` files for both the folders with your own credential.
  - Go to Spotify Developers API and create an account.
  - Generate an API key and replace the key with your own in the `.env` file.

# Starting the server
  - First start the backend by navigating to `backend` and doing `npm start` or `node.js`.
  - Start the frontend by navigating to `frontend` and doing `npm start` or `npm run app`.

The application will be accessible on http://localhost/3000.
